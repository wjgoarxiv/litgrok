A redesign changes how a product looks, never what a user can finish. Capture the old behavior
first; after the first edit nobody can tell a regression from an intended change.

## Baseline capture

Capture before touching a file. No baseline means no parity list and no regression guard.

- Pin the pre-change revision; its `source_hash` is the baseline identity.
- Capture every affected route at `compact` and `expanded`.
- Capture `loading`, `empty`, `error`, `disabled`, and overflow per route.
- Record tab order, focus targets, and step count for each critical task.

## Debt map

Classify debt before proposing a treatment; the category decides how far the fix reaches.

1. Structural: buried primary action, wrong heading order, grouping that misleads.
2. Systemic: duplicated raw values, two spacing scales, forked copies of a component.
3. Accessibility: missing names, suppressed focus, contrast failures, unreachable controls.
4. Responsive: overflow, content hidden with no named alternative, targets lost.
5. Behavioral: no recovery path, destroyed input, missing progress feedback.
6. Aesthetic: dated treatment with no functional cost.

Rank by what a user cannot do. Aesthetic debt alone does not justify opening a surface.

## Decision per surface

Record exactly one of four decisions per inventory surface, with one line of reasoning.

- Preserve: it works, so it stays out of the diff.
- Change: same structure and behavior, new visual treatment.
- Replace: new implementation of identical guarantees, migration path named.
- Remove: deleted, stating where the capability now lives or why it is gone.

An undecided surface is out of scope. `Remove` requires explicit user approval.

## Staged sequence

Order the work so the product ships at the end of every stage.

1. Land tokens and primitives with no visual change; prove parity.
2. Migrate one low-traffic route end to end as the pattern the rest copy.
3. Migrate remaining routes in traffic order, one route per stage.
4. Keep behavioral fixes in their own stages, never folded into a visual stage.
5. Delete the superseded path only after its last consumer moves.

A stage that cannot ship alone is too large. Split it.

## Parity list

These hold at every stage boundary. Check the captured baseline, not memory.

- Every task completable at baseline completes in the same or fewer steps.
- URLs, deep links, and query parameters resolve to the same surfaces.
- Data meaning, units, precision, sort order, and permissions are unchanged.
- Keyboard reach, focus order, and accessible names are equal or better.
- Every baseline state still exists and is still reachable.

A surviving break is a defect until an owner accepts it in `accepted_exceptions` with an expiry.

## Settling a design debate

Time-box the argument and end it in a written decision.

1. Restate the disagreement as a question about a user outcome, not taste.
2. Put at most two options on the table, each with its cost named.
3. Settle it with the baseline, a measurement, or a rule in the contract.
4. After two rounds, take the reversible option, log the other as an owned assumption, and
   reopen only on new evidence.

## Regression guards

Add the guard in the same stage as the change it protects.

- Keep existing assertions passing; a rewritten assertion hides the regression.
- Add one test per behavioral fix that fails against the baseline.
- Recapture each migrated route at both widths.
- Re-run the accessibility, build, and lint gates every stage.

## Closeout

Close only when the record is complete.

- Every surface carries one of the four decisions plus matching evidence.
- The parity list holds, or each break has an owner and an expiry.
- The final artifact reached the independent review pass bound to the design contract hash.
- The receipt states `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED` and names unresolved deviations.
