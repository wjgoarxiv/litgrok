# Swift — LSP setup (Grok Build / LitGrok)

- **Recommended server:** `sourcekit-lsp`
- **Extensions:** `.swift .objc .objcpp`
- **Install hint:** `Included with Xcode or the Swift toolchain`

## Install

`sourcekit-lsp` ships with the Swift toolchain — no separate install.

- **macOS:** `xcode-select --install` (or install full Xcode). It resolves to the active toolchain selected by `xcode-select`.
- **Linux:** Install a swift.org toolchain (`sourcekit-lsp` ships inside it); add the toolchain's `usr/bin` to PATH.
- **Windows:** Install the swift.org Windows toolchain; `sourcekit-lsp` is bundled.

Confirm it resolves:

```bash
command -v sourcekit-lsp
```

## Server settings

Grok Build documents no project language-server schema, and LitGrok ships no server
configuration: the only documented code-intelligence surface is the built-in tool
behind `GROK_LSP_TOOLS=1` / `[features] lsp_tools`, which is off by default (see the
`lsp` skill). Installing the server binary on PATH is the whole setup this reference
can vouch for. Do not add a server entry to `.grok/config.toml`; that key is not a
documented Grok Build surface.

## Alternatives

**No mainstream alternative.** `sourcekit-lsp` is the official Apple/swift.org
server and the only practical choice.

## Troubleshooting

- **PATH:** `sourcekit-lsp` on PATH; reopen shell after install (or after `xcode-select -s`).
- **Wrong toolchain (macOS):** point `xcode-select` at the right Xcode/toolchain; mismatches cause stale or missing results.
- **No `Package.swift` / compile db:** add a SwiftPM manifest or generate `compile_commands.json` for accurate indexing.
- **Objective-C (`.objc`/`.objcpp`):** needs a compilation database to resolve headers and frameworks.
- **First build slow:** the server builds the module graph on first open; wait for it.

## Verify

```bash
command -v sourcekit-lsp
```

A resolving executable is the only claim this reference makes. Whether Grok Build's
built-in code-intelligence tool picks the server up is undocumented; confirm tool
visibility inside the session as the `lsp` skill describes, and fall back to the
project's own checks when it is absent.
