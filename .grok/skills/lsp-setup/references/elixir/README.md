# Elixir — LSP setup (Grok Build / LitGrok)

- **Recommended server:** `elixir-ls`
- **Extensions:** `.ex .exs`
- **Install hint:** `https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls`

## Install

ElixirLS needs Erlang/OTP and Elixir installed first. Build the release from
`https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls` and put the `elixir-ls` launcher script on PATH.

- **macOS:** `brew install elixir-ls` (Homebrew provides the launcher), or build the release manually
- **Linux:** clone elixir-ls, run `mix deps.get && mix compile && mix elixir_ls.release2 -o release`, then add `release/` to PATH
- **Windows:** build the release and add the `release` dir (use the `.bat` launcher) to PATH

Confirm it resolves:

```bash
command -v elixir-ls
```

## Server settings

Grok Build documents no project language-server schema, and LitGrok ships no server
configuration: the only documented code-intelligence surface is the built-in tool
behind `GROK_LSP_TOOLS=1` / `[features] lsp_tools`, which is off by default (see the
`lsp` skill). Installing the server binary on PATH is the whole setup this reference
can vouch for. Do not add a server entry to `.grok/config.toml`; that key is not a
documented Grok Build surface.

## Alternatives

- **lexical**: launch it as `lexical` — fast, modern alternative LSP.
- **next-ls**: launch it as `nextls --stdio` — from the elixir-tools project.

## Troubleshooting
- **PATH:** `elixir-ls` must be on PATH; reopen the shell after install.
- **asdf users:** the launcher is a shim — after `asdf install`, run `asdf reshim elixir` so the `elixir-ls` shim resolves, and ensure the Erlang/Elixir versions match the build.
- **First start is slow:** ElixirLS compiles your deps on first run; initial diagnostics can take a while on large projects.
- **OTP mismatch:** build elixir-ls with the same Erlang/Elixir versions you use for the project to avoid bytecode errors.

## Verify

```bash
command -v elixir-ls
```

A resolving executable is the only claim this reference makes. Whether Grok Build's
built-in code-intelligence tool picks the server up is undocumented; confirm tool
visibility inside the session as the `lsp` skill describes, and fall back to the
project's own checks when it is absent.
