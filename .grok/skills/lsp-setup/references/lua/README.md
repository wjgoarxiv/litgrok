# Lua — LSP setup (Grok Build / LitGrok)

- **Recommended server:** `lua-language-server`
- **Extensions:** `.lua`
- **Install hint:** `https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server`

## Install

See `https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server`.

- **macOS:** `brew install lua-language-server`
- **Linux:** download a release from GitHub, or `pacman -S lua-language-server` (Arch) / AUR
- **Windows:** download a release from the GitHub releases page and add its `bin` to PATH

Confirm it resolves:

```bash
command -v lua-language-server
```

## Server settings

Grok Build documents no project language-server schema, and LitGrok ships no server
configuration: the only documented code-intelligence surface is the built-in tool
behind `GROK_LSP_TOOLS=1` / `[features] lsp_tools`, which is off by default (see the
`lsp` skill). Installing the server binary on PATH is the whole setup this reference
can vouch for. Do not add a server entry to `.grok/config.toml`; that key is not a
documented Grok Build surface.

## Alternatives

None.

## Troubleshooting
- **PATH:** `lua-language-server` must be on PATH; reopen the shell after install.
- **Undefined `vim` global:** add `vim` to `diagnostics.globals` and set `workspace.library` in `.luarc.json` (see above) for Neovim work.
- **Wrong runtime version:** set `runtime.version` (`LuaJIT`, `Lua 5.4`, etc.) to match your interpreter, or stdlib functions report as undefined.

## Verify

```bash
command -v lua-language-server
```

A resolving executable is the only claim this reference makes. Whether Grok Build's
built-in code-intelligence tool picks the server up is undocumented; confirm tool
visibility inside the session as the `lsp` skill describes, and fall back to the
project's own checks when it is absent.
