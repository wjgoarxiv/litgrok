# Dart — LSP setup (Grok Build / LitGrok)

- **Recommended server:** `dart language-server --lsp`
- **Extensions:** `.dart`
- **Install hint:** `Included with the Dart/Flutter SDK`

## Install

The language server ships inside the Dart SDK (and the Flutter SDK, which bundles Dart). There is no separate package to install — just put `dart` (or `flutter`) on PATH.

- **macOS:** `brew install dart` (or install Flutter and use its bundled `dart`)
- **Linux:** install the Dart SDK from your package manager / `https://dart.dev/get-dart`, or install Flutter
- **Windows:** install the Dart SDK or Flutter SDK and add its `bin` to PATH

Confirm it resolves:

```bash
command -v dart
```

## Server settings

Grok reads language servers from project `.grok/lsp.json` and from `~/.grok/lsp.json`. The project file wins when both name the same server. A trusted plugin may add a server; LitGrok does not ship one. The built-in tool stays off until `GROK_LSP_TOOLS=1` or user `[features] lsp_tools` (see the `lsp` skill).

On Grok 1.0.13, `grok inspect --json` listed a server only for a string `command`, a string array `args`, and `extensionToLanguage`. This is the entry that loaded. Use this page's binary as `command` and put flags such as `--stdio` in `args`.

```json
{
  "typescript": {
    "command": "typescript-language-server",
    "args": ["--stdio"],
    "extensionToLanguage": { ".ts": "typescript" }
  }
}
```

The same inspect dropped a `command` that was itself an array, and it dropped a file whose only key was `lspServers`. Do not put the entry in `.grok/config.toml`.

Grok's documentation names the two `lsp.json` paths and does not name these fields. Only that one shape was probed, for one TypeScript server. Other fields, a `command` with no `args`, and the plugin file format were not probed. Installing the binary on PATH is still required, and LitGrok still does not write `lsp.json`.

## Alternatives

None.

## Troubleshooting
- **PATH:** `dart` must be on PATH; reopen the shell after installing the SDK. Flutter users: ensure `<flutter>/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin` or the Flutter `bin` is exported.
- **Flutter vs Dart:** if you only have Flutter installed, the bundled `dart` works — make sure Flutter's `bin` is on PATH rather than relying on a separate Dart install.
- **SDK out of date:** run `dart --version` / `flutter upgrade` if analysis behaves oddly on newer language features.

## Verify

```bash
command -v dart
```

A resolving executable is the only claim this reference makes. Whether Grok Build's
built-in code-intelligence tool picks the server up is undocumented; confirm tool
visibility inside the session as the `lsp` skill describes, and fall back to the
project's own checks when it is absent.
