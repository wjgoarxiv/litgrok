# Bash — LSP setup (Grok Build / LitGrok)

- **Recommended server:** `bash-language-server start`
- **Extensions:** `.sh .bash .zsh .ksh`
- **Install hint:** `npm install -g bash-language-server`

## Install

- **macOS:** `npm install -g bash-language-server`
- **Linux:** `npm install -g bash-language-server`
- **Windows:** `npm install -g bash-language-server` (PowerShell)

For real diagnostics, also install `shellcheck`:

- **macOS:** `brew install shellcheck`
- **Linux:** `apt install shellcheck` (or `dnf install ShellCheck`)
- **Windows:** `scoop install shellcheck`

Confirm it resolves:

```bash
command -v bash-language-server
command -v shellcheck
```

## Server settings

Grok Build documents no project language-server schema, and LitGrok ships no server
configuration: the only documented code-intelligence surface is the built-in tool
behind `GROK_LSP_TOOLS=1` / `[features] lsp_tools`, which is off by default (see the
`lsp` skill). Installing the server binary on PATH is the whole setup this reference
can vouch for. Do not add a server entry to `.grok/config.toml`; that key is not a
documented Grok Build surface.

## Alternatives

- `shellcheck` standalone as a linter-only flow (no LSP).
- `shfmt` for formatting (complements, does not replace, the LSP).

## Troubleshooting
- **PATH:** `bash-language-server` on PATH; reopen shell after `npm -g` install.
- **No diagnostics:** `shellcheck` missing — diagnostics are powered by it; install and reopen.
- **Wrong shell dialect:** `.zsh`/`.ksh` are linted as bash; shellcheck may flag shell-specific syntax.

## Verify

```bash
command -v bash-language-server
```

A resolving executable is the only claim this reference makes. Whether Grok Build's
built-in code-intelligence tool picks the server up is undocumented; confirm tool
visibility inside the session as the `lsp` skill describes, and fall back to the
project's own checks when it is absent.
